Subject: [PATCH 017/280] dm-crypt: start allocating with MAX_ORDER

Commit 23baf831a32c ("mm, treewide: redefine MAX_ORDER sanely")
changed the meaning of MAX_ORDER from exclusive to inclusive. So, we
can allocate compound pages with up to 1 << MAX_ORDER pages.

Reflect this change in dm-crypt and start trying to allocate compound
pages with MAX_ORDER.
